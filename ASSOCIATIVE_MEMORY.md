# Associative Memory (Co-Visitation Tracking)

## Overview

The memory server now includes **associative memory** capabilities inspired by how human brains work. When you view a file, the server automatically shows you related files that have been viewed together in the past.

## How It Works

### 1. **Session Tracking**
- The server uses FastMCP's built-in session IDs to track file accesses
- Files accessed within the same MCP session (client connection) are considered related
- Each session has a unique ID that persists across multiple tool calls

### 2. **Co-Visitation Index**
- A JSON index (`_covis.json`) tracks which files are viewed together
- Every time 2+ files are accessed in a session, their co-visitation count increases
- The index is stored in: `{MEMORY_DIR}/_covis.json`

### 3. **Related File Recommendations**
- When you view a file, the server automatically:
  1. Shows the primary file content
  2. Finds up to 3 related files (configurable)
  3. Includes the content of related files inline

## Example Output

When viewing a file that has related files:

```
   1: # My Notes
   2: This is the main content
   3: ...

============================================================
ðŸ§  RELATED FILES (Associative Memory)
============================================================

[1] patterns/similar_topic.md (co-visited 5x)
------------------------------------------------------------
Content of the related file...

[2] accounts/context.txt (co-visited 3x)
------------------------------------------------------------
More related content...
```

## Configuration

Control associative memory behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Maximum number of related files to show (default: 3)
export MEMORY_COVIS_MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS=5

# Maximum characters to show per related file (default: 2000)
export MEMORY_COVIS_MAX_RELATED_CHARS=3000
```

## Benefits

1. **Contextual Awareness**: Automatically surfaces related context when viewing files
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from your access patterns over time
3. **Reduced Manual Navigation**: No need to manually open related files
4. **Inter-Session Memory**: Recommendations persist across different sessions

## Privacy & Storage

- The co-visitation index only stores file paths and counts
- No file content is stored in the index
- The index is stored locally in your memory directory
- File paths are normalized to prevent path traversal attacks

## Technical Details

### Co-Visitation Algorithm

For each session with files [A, B, C]:
- Record pairs: (A,B), (A,C), (B,C)
- Increment co-visitation count for each pair
- Store bidirectional relationships

### Recommendation Ranking

Files are ranked by:
1. Co-visitation count (higher = more related)
2. File path (alphabetical tiebreaker)

### Session Definition

A "session" is defined by the **FastMCP session ID**:
- Each MCP client connection has a unique session ID (via `Context.session_id`)
- Files accessed within the same session are tracked together
- Session persists across multiple tool calls
- Co-visitation updated after each file access (if 2+ files in session)
- Old session data is cleaned up periodically to prevent memory buildup

## Implementation Notes

Based on the reference implementation provided, with adaptations for:
- **FastMCP session tracking**: Uses `Context.session_id` for proper session management
- **Path security**: Normalization and traversal protection
- **Response truncation**: Optimal token usage
- **Atomic file writes**: Index persistence
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of old session data

### Key Improvements Over Reference Implementation

1. **True Session Tracking**: Uses FastMCP's built-in `session_id` instead of a sliding window
2. **Persistent Sessions**: Session data persists across multiple tool calls within the same MCP connection
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents memory buildup by cleaning old sessions after 100 file accesses
4. **Context-Aware**: Leverages FastMCP Context for session identification
5. **MCP Protocol Compliant**: Follows official MCP recommendations for session management

### MCP Protocol Alignment

According to the **Model Context Protocol specification**:
- Sessions maintain continuity across related interactions
- Session IDs group requests within the same "conversation"
- Servers should maintain context for requests with the same session ID

Our implementation correctly uses session IDs to identify which file accesses are contextually related, following MCP's intended purpose for sessions.
